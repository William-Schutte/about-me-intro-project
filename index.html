        <p class="card__text">
          I took Practicum's Software Engineer program during 2020 and graduated
          in the very beginning of 2021. It was a lot of hard work, but it
          really paid off and I'm so happy I was able to change careers into
          something I can see myself doing for many years.

        <p class="card__text">
          I love hiking and backpacking and adventuring outdoors. I plan on
          hiking a lot more in 2022 as travel becomes a little more viable.
          Hoping to canoe through the Ozarks, hike over the Andes to Machu
          Picchu in Peru, and backpack in the famous Yosemite Valley.
